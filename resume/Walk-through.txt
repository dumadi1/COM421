The first index page is the information about me page with a navigation on the left pane which takes you to my resume with an option to download. The website to me came out decent in my opinion not the best as font styling is kind of hard for me. I think I would have done better with fonts if I had more time to research for which fits best where. I would have added some graphics to my projects to give some visual. I would have also worked on view ports for different screens.
